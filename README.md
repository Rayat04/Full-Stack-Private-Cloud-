# Full Stack Private Cloud Implementation

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **private cloud storage system** using **Nextcloud** on **Rocky Linux 9.6**, deployed inside **Oracle VirtualBox**.

The system provides secure file storage, sharing, and synchronization features similar to commercial cloud services such as Google Drive and Dropbox, while maintaining full control over data and infrastructure.
