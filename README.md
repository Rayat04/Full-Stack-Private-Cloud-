# Full Stack Private Cloud Implementation

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **private cloud storage system** using **Nextcloud** on **Rocky Linux 9.6**, deployed inside **Oracle VirtualBox**.

The system provides secure file storage, sharing, and synchronization features similar to commercial cloud services such as Google Drive and Dropbox, while maintaining full control over data and infrastructure.


## Tools & Technologies Used
- Oracle VirtualBox
- Rocky Linux 9.6 (64-bit)
- Apache HTTP Server
- MariaDB Database
- PHP 8.2
- Nextcloud Hub
- Firewalld


## System Architecture
The private cloud system is deployed on a virtual machine using a full LAMP stack:
- Linux as the operating system
- Apache as the web server
- MariaDB as the database backend
- PHP as the runtime environment
- Nextcloud as the cloud application

The virtual machine is configured using a **Bridged Network Adapter**, enabling access from external devices on the same network.


## Key Features
- Self-hosted private cloud storage
- Secure file upload and download
- Web-based user interface
- Cross-platform access (Windows & Android)
- Full data ownership and privacy
